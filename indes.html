            <h1>Kainan Smith, Goobie Snoobert</h1>
            <p>My name is Kainan Smith, I like to make music.  I also like to play video games.  My favorite kind of games are fighting games because there is <i>always</i> more you can learn about them.  I was born in a hospital in Urbana, Illinois.  Then, I moved to Indiana shortly after.  Then, when I was 9, I moved up here.  I want to go into game design because I want the ability to create the type of games I would want to play myself.</p>
