            <h1>Kainan Smith</h1>
            <p>My name is Kainan Smith, I was born in a hospital in Urbana, Illinois on January 6, 2008.  Then, I moved to Indiana shortly after.  Then, when I was 9, I moved up here.  I like to make music and play video games.  I want to go into game design because I want the ability to create the type of games I would want to play myself.</p>

            <p>The people in my family are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunday - Mom, Midwife</li>
                <li>Brad - Dad, Chef</li>
                <li>Kennie - Brother, Environmental Studies Majors</li>
            </ul>>
           <p>My favorite kind of games are fighting games because there is <i>always</i> more you can learn about them, there's a website I like to use called <a href="https://www.dustloop.com/w/Main_Page">Dustloop</a>, which is an encyclopedia filled with resources for different fighting games.</p>

           <p>My end goal is to go into some kind of development field that I'll like alright, and on the side I'll make games with my friends that we and other people will (hopefully) like.</p>
